* You should install Node-RED (which requires Node.js), and use it to connect to the MQTT broker for flow-based control and visualization.
* You should use Node-RED to create a flow that connects to the MQTT broker and subscribes and publishes to a number of MQTT topics. You should use a Node-RED dashboard to visualize sensor values using gauges and graphs, and to issue commands to water the plant, update the sensor values and control and monitor automatic/manual mode. You should also show the online status of your thing in the dashboard. You may use any Node-RED plugin, as long as you give credit.

Nice to have:
* Over The Air (OTA) updates. Will you support updating your thing from the Arduino IDE in a wireless fashion? It may sound complex but again thereâ€™s a library for that.
